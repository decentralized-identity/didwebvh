## Abstract

The `did:webvh` DID Method is an enhancement to the well-known `did:web` DID
method, providing a complementary web-based DID method that addresses
limitations of `did:web`, most notability, the verifiable history for which it
is name. `did:webvh` features include the following.

- Ongoing publishing of all DID Document (DIDDoc) versions for a DID instead of,
  or alongside a `did:web` DID/DIDDoc.
- Uses the same DID-to-HTTPS transformation as `did:web`.
- Provides resolvers the full history of the DID using a verifiable chain of
  updates to the DIDDoc from genesis to deactivation.
- A self-certifying identifier (SCID) for the DID that is globally
  unique and derived from the initial DIDDoc that enables DID portability, such
  as moving the DIDs web location (and so the DID string itself) while retaining
  the DID's history.
- DIDDoc updates include a proof signed by the DID Controller(s) *authorized* to
  update the DID.
- An optional mechanism for publishing "pre-rotation" keys to prevent loss of
  control of the DID in cases where an active private key is compromised.
- An optional mechanism for having collaborating "witnesses"
  that approve updates to the DID by the DID Controller before publication.
- DID URL path handling that defaults (but can be overridden) to automatically
  resolving `<did>/path/to/file` by using a comparable DID-to-HTTPS translation
  as for the DIDDoc.
- A DID URL path `<did>/whois` that defaults to automatically returning (if
  published by the DID controller) a Verifiable Presentation containing
  Verifiable Credentials with the DID as the `credentialSubject`,
  signed by the DID.

Combined, the additional features enable greater trust, security and
verifiability without compromising the simplicity of `did:web`. The incorporation
of the DID Core compatible "/whois" path, drawing inspiration from the
traditional WHOIS protocol, offers an easy to use, decentralized, trust
registry. `did:webvh` aims to establish a more trusted and secure web
environment by providing robust verification processes and enabling transparency
and authenticity in the management of decentralized digital identities.

## Contributing to the Specification

Pull requests (PRs) to this repository may be accepted. Each commit of a PR must
have a DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin -
[https://github.com/apps/dco](https://github.com/apps/dco)) sign-off. This can
be done from the command line by adding the `-s` (lower case) option on the `git
commit` command (e.g., `git commit -s -m "Comment about the commit"`).

Rendering and reviewing the spec locally for testing requires `npm` and `node`
installed. Follow these steps:

- Fork and locally clone the repository.
- Install `node` and `npm`.
- Run `npm install` from the root of your local repository.
- Edit the spec documents (in the `/spec` folder).
- Run `npm run render`'
  - Use `npm run edit` to interactively edit, render and review the spec.
- Review the resulting `index.html` file in a browser.

The specification is currently in [Spec-Up] format. See the
[Spec-Up Documentation] for a list of Spec-Up features and functionality.

## Publishing Previous Spec Versions

[Spec-Up] allows for multiple versions of the spec to be rendered and accessed
on the same site. We use that feature for the `did:webvh` DID Method spec to snapshot
previous versions of the spec for reference.

To create a snapshot of a version:

- Make a new folder in the root of the repository for the new version, called `spec-v<ver>`. For example `v0.3`.
- Copy the `spec` folder markdown files from the point of that version into the new folder. If you are doing this process as you are starting a new version, you can just copy the files from the `spec` folder of the main branch. Otherwise, you have to find the last commit of the version and get the files from that point in the GitHub history.
- Update the `specs.json` file to include a new specification:
  - Copy the primary spec entry text.
  - Paste that text into a new spec entry in the `"specs"` array.
  - Update the `"spec_directory"` property to be the name of the new folder you created.
  - Update the `"output_path"` property to be `./v<ver>`. For example `"./v0.3"`.
  - Append to the `"title"` property the version ` - Version <ver>`, For example ` - Version 0.3`.
  - If the current version of the spec is also a named version (e.g. v0.5), create two entries for that spec -- one with the `output_path` to the landing page (`./`), and the second to the version (`./v0.5`). Later, when a new version is added, leave the `./v0.5` entry as is, and update the landing page as appropriate.
- Add a link to the versioned specification in the `Previous Drafts` bullet list, in the `header.md` file in the main spec, so that readers can click on it from the main specification.
- Update the `header.md` file of the new version spec folder (e.g in `spec-v0.3`) to:
  - Change the status to `HISTORICAL -- **THIS IS NOT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE SPECIFICATION**`
  - As appropriate, add guidance for readers **WITHOUT** altering the version of the specification itself.
  - Remove the `Past Drafts` section and put a relative link back to the current spec -- such as:

```text
**Latest Version:**

- Specification: [https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/](../)
- Repository: [https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh)

```

## Handling Version Transitions

In the lifecycle of the specification, there will be times when the latest version is
stable, with clarifications being added, and other times when new versions are being defined
with breaking changes.  We use the Spec-Up multiple versions feature
(as described above) to support that, but it can get a little tricky. Notably, we want
the landing page for the specification to **always** be the current version of
the specification, **and** we want all "in progress" work to be to made to the
single, primary specification -- the files in the `spec` folder -- so that GitHub
holds the full history of the specification.  To enable that, we adjust as
needed the `"output_path"` in the `specs.json` file to define what version of
the spec is on the specification landing page -- the spec version whose
`"output_path"` is set to `"./"`).

Here's how we do that in different situations:

- The specification website landing page is always the current stable version of
  the specification, and past versions plus the next version ("Editor's Draft")
  are linked in that folder's `header.md` file.
- The `spec` folder is the `./next` folder and is called the `Editor's Draft`.
  Immediately after a stable version is announced, it is a copy of the newly
  stable version, but will evolve from there. Clarifications may be applied
  `spec-vx.x` folder, and if so, they **MUST** also be applied to the Editor's
  Draft.
- When a new, stable version of the specification is ready:
  - Snapshot the editor's version by creating a new directory (e.g.,
    `spec-v0.6`) and copying the files from the `spec` folder into the new
    folder.
  - Create a new entry in the `specs.json` file for that new snapshot version.
  - Set the `output_path` of the new version (e.g., `spec-v0.6`) to be `"./"`,
    so that it becomes the landing page.
  - Change the `output_path` of the new version (e.g., `spec-v0.5`) to be `"./vx.x`.
  - Update the `header.json` files in the new folder, the `spec` folder, and the
    previously stable version as needed. Remember that,
    - the newly declared and created version is the landing page, `./`,
    - the editor's draft is `./next`, and
    - the former stable version, now a "Previous Version" is `./vx.x`.
  - Add any notes to the heard to help readers understand the
    status of the current and next versions of the specification.
