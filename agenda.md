4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. TO DO: Patrick to open an issue to review the witness logic and code in the Python implementation to match the latest changes to the spec, clarifying that an empty dictionary for witness means it's deactivated.
    2. DONE: Patrick to address the review comments on the server watcher plugin for deployment in the sandbox environment.
    3. TO DO: Stephen to add a note in the deactivate section regarding the deactivation of a DID and its implications on resolution.
    4. TO DO: Stephen to include guidance on deactivation in the DID resolution spec, mentioning the state being empty and returning a "not found" status.
    5. DONE: Stephen to add an issue regarding the crypto suite discussion and defer it for a version 2 discussion.
    6. DONE: Stephen to check the status of did:webvh's acceptance on a standards track for W3C.
    7. TO DO: Stephen to propose another presentation about did:webvh at the CCG to update folks about the comment period.
    8. TO DO: Patrick to follow up with UNTP about their interest in implementing did:webvh.


5. [PRs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pulls) Review
    1. Discuss and merge if possible.
    2. PRs merged, except the security and privacy one (new). More changes pending on that after the meeting.

6. Question from Victor Dods. If there is more than one entry in the `updateKeys` what happens if you have two keys used to make different parallel updates to the DID? (From this [issue comment](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/pull/67#issuecomment-3177377431)).
    1. Separate out the two cases of malicious vs. accidental.
        1. Accidental. Mitigations:
            1. did:webvh server could detect and prevent.
            2. did:webvh witnesses would detect and prevent.
            3. did:webvh watchers would detect and prevent.
        2. Malicious.
            1. Loss of key -- mitigation is the use of pre-rotation.
            2. All of the other mitigations apply, but in a different way -- detecting an invalid update.

7. Question from Victor Dods as [issue #246](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/246) explicitly address in the spec that a DID Controller should not reuse an update / pre-rotation key.
    1. Discussed and agreed we should add a note recommending against doing so in line with key handling best practices, but there is not a requirement for the resolver to track/detect/invalidate the DID if that is done. A resolver can do that, but not required.

8. Other [Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues) Review
    1. Issues reviewed, some closed based on the PRs merged earlier in the meeting.

9. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

2. Announcements:
    1. did:webvh [Implementations] repo created. Background provided later in the meeting.
    2. did:webvh Deep Dive completed at DIF/W3C DID Methods Standardization Working Group -- [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/6GhsVQ6VCIQiM5YyqkeAr4zg9RxcfxriKSi3tqQp5v0nad7Gdp52uXe5Pm3B26nz.SdHHNRMZJJcWmzZn), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VCD4z6yQ1nGezFngWWLDZ9xL6xnA8pkX5992jq0xEfA/edit?usp=sharing).

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- updates made to align with others.
    2. [Python] -- No updates -- interop and performance tests run.
    3. [Rust] -- No updates
    4. [Affinidi Rust] -- updates, interop testing, performance testing.
    5. [Server-Py] -- ready for use -- policy rules still being completed.
    6. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    7. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    8. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- policy implementation to match the server. DIDComm protocols for the witnessing -- both for log entries and for attested resources (initial use -- AnonCreds objects). Works with the ACA-Py Endorser Server repository at OWF. Allows control/governance over what can be published by a given instance of ACA-Py. Iterations of how to handle this -- now at a good place, including auto-approval and approval.
    9. [Test Suite] -- 
    10. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- 
    11. [Implementations] -- repo added, populated with initial implementations.

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. [PR 233](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/233) DONE - Stephen to update the did:webvh specification with clearer guidelines on optional parameters and default values.
    2. DONE - Stephen to add the witness proof file analysis to the [FAQ section](https://didwebvh.info/latest/faq/) of the specification.
    3. DONE? - Glenn to make the performance testing code available for other implementations to use.
    4. DONE - Stephen to monitor and participate in discussions about DID method standardization at W3C.
    5. IN PROGRESS - Stephen to submit PRs for the pending issues listed in the specification repository.
    6. DONE Stephen to create a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348111717639344128/) announcing the release of ACA-Py 1.3.1 with did:webvh support.

5. Continued from last meeting, but with a concrete PR in place about what should be in the spec when describing optional parameters.
    1. Big question -- is this a new version, or leave it as 1.0?
       1. Decision -- leave it as 1.0. The added deprecation/resolver guidance in the PR will allow us to justify that.

6. New issues from implementation iterations:
    1. [\#235](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/235) -- Method can only increase -- agreed
    2. [\#236](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/236) -- Clarifying resolver witness proof handling requirements -- agreement, PR to be added.
    3. [\#234](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/234) -- Verifiable history of resources. Agreed that while this is interesting, it is not likely did:webvh specific. Could be a separate spec, or perhaps added in a later did:webvh version.
    4. Other PRs and Issues. Looked at the did:web one and almost ready -- Stephen has since added an update to deal with the `/whois` with a parallel DID.

7. The [Implementations] repo -- an overview from Patrick St. Louis.

8. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:
    1. Affinidi performance testing results.
        - 10 years of monthly DID updates -- 120 log entries.
        - Periodic witness and watcher updates
        - 197kb Log, 5.9kb witness file
        - 50ms to generate the log
        - 28ms to verify the log
        - "This is a very good performance result compared to other high-trust traceable DIDs (Keri, BlockChain). I can validate ~10 years of WebVH history in under 30ms, faster than likely fetching a web3 DID ;)"
    2. New: did:webvh implementations (TS, PY) pass the DID Test Suite ([link](https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#M51)).
      - Had to tweak the DID resolution document metadata for `threshold`, converting it a string when resolving -- still an integer in the Log Entry.

4. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- working through change requests from Credo Team. Dealing with two version of Credo. Update for the `threshold` metadata.
    2. [Python] -- 
    3. [Rust] -- 
    4. [Server-Py] -- Policy features nearing completion.
    5. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    6. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    7. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- Updated for ACA-Py 1.3.1 -- now deployable on a released version of ACA-Py.
    8. [Test Suite] -- 
    9. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- Updated for v1.0 spec.

5. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. Stephen to update the tutorial page on the web info site with Affinidi's tutorial details.
    2. DONE - Stephen to pursue clarification on witness handling with Glenn from Affinidi, based on Patrick's input.
    3. DONE - Stephen to add an issue and PR for adding service endpoints to the did:web equivalent of did:webvh.
    4. DONE - Stephen to add a note about including "also known as" references in both did:webvh and did:web documents.
    5. Patrick to update the tutorial to include service endpoints in the did:web example.
    6. IN PROGRESS - BC Gov team to continue work on implementing a production-level did:webvh system with policy enforcement mechanisms.
    7. IN PROGRESS - Patrick to continue development of the did:webvh server with configurable policy enforcement features.
    8. IN PROGRESS - Patrick to develop the endorser service as a plugin for supporting did:webvh in Traction.

8. Discussion on what should be in the spec when describing optional parameters.  How do we get the wording right to remove ambiguity?

   - Need developer input to get the wording right.
   
   - It gets tricky for the first entry (requires defaulting to some value) vs. later entries (previous value holds).
   
   - In future, when a DID changes the spec it is using, that may result in new parameters needing to be defaulted if not explicitly specified.
       - Changelog contents -- must include what new parameters and their defaults?
   
   - Must have a way to explictly turn off a value -- so include it but set it to the default -- not `null`.
   
   - Need to handle these issues:
       - Array -- "[]"
       - Dict -- "{}"
       - Strings -- "".
       - Avoid null, because null is not typed.
       - MUST: Accept parameters that are set to the default.
       - Optional parameters need not be present and if not present MUST be set to default.
   
   - Relevant part of the spec is [here](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0/#didwebvh-did-method-parameters).
   
   - Idea:
     - Define default value if not specified in the first applicable entry. Implementations can use that to initialize the setting.
     - Define allowed values if specified. In defining that, note the value to use to "turn off" a parameter.

7. Do we revert an earlier decision and put the witness proofs back into the DID Log? **NO!**
    - Eliminates the separate file/retrieval.
    - Allows "as you go" witnessing of Log Entries.
    - Increases the size of Log Files because witness proofs cannot be "optimized" -- removed when later ones are added.
        - Good to get an estimate on this.
        - Glenn Gore ([Affinidi](https://www.affinidi.com/)) provided us with one -- [Witness Proofs in Logs -- Test Scenario and Analysis](https://hackmd.io/-elL5qKYQgymxLUJxvDggg?view)
        - Based on the analysis, the increase in file size, plus the time to process the additional witness proofs makes the current scheme of separate files better -- we'll keep it.
    - Method -- Add proofs of witnesses to the `proof` item array.
        - I recall we discussed this earlier and decided not to use that approach because "proof sets" was not standardized?
        - Presumably, the proofs in an array have to be over the same content? If so, the witness "payload" for the proof would change to be in the same `proof` item.

8. Open Discussion -- what do you want to discuss?
