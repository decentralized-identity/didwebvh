    4. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.
    5. Finding an inventory of normative statements -- beyond search for `**MUST**`, etc.

7. Discussion about the "phone home" meme and `did:webvh`
    1. Discussed and there was agreement that some text should be put into the Security and Privacy section about the issue.

    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-ts) -- Some progress on the Credo integration, adding AnonCreds. Having to write some custom code for DI proofs. Potential issue -- proof arrays vs. proof object in Credo. (Great) Idea from Dmitri -- create a JSON Schema for the did:webvh log entry -- added issue [203](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/203).
    2. [Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-py) -- No changes
    3. [Rust](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-rs) -- No further updates.
    3. [Server Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-server-py) -- Evolving with ACA-Py plugin
    4. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/anoncreds-method/) -- done
    5. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy-plugins/tree/main/webvh) -- Evolving with did:webvh Server Python. Now deployed into Traction, and now doing improvements for operations. Working on a witness queue. ACA-Py handling of keys. Collaborating with the Cheqd folks on common issues with key handling/usage.
    6. [did:webvh Static](https://github.com/OpSecId/webvh-static) -- will likely evolve into the test suite. Really needed!!

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. DONE Andrew to update the examples in the did-webvh-py library to v0.6, including removing the weight parameter and adding watcher URLs for testing validation.
    2. DONE - Stephen to update the specification with the latest examples (at least to v0.5, ideally to v0.6/v1.0).
    3. DONE - Stephen to clean up and clarify the specification language, particularly regarding null parameters and witness thresholds.
    4. TODO Stephen to update the didwebvh.info site with information about watchers.
    5. TODO Stephen to prepare the specification for declaration as version 1.0, allowing for final cleanups and clarifications.
    6. REALLY? Patrick to reach out to the Swiss government team to discuss their implementation and potential update to version 1.0.
    7. NEEDED! Team to consider developing a test suite for backwards compatibility, particularly for v0.3.

5. Comments and feedback from Brian's use of AI to generate critiques of did:webvh and a comparison of it vs. other web-based DID methods.  See the assessments [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108sasow3PzJoS1VnL8xx_0_1MhoB4rLtxS1t3WIuQXs/edit?usp=sharing).
    1. Performance concerns -- JSONL/caching, publishing benchmarks.
        1. Show an example -- e.g. version per week for 50 years -- how big is the file?  Processing time?
    3. GDPR concern -- really?
    4. Enhancing cryptographic agility.
        1. *"The specification lacks clear mechanisms for graceful cryptographic agility within the log itself. How would a transition to a new hash function or signature suite be managed mid-history?"* -- need to clarify.
    6. webs and webplus are "higher-assurance methods" -- really?
    7. Concerns about updates - atomicity/concurrency, file growth, non-database file. Given the context of DID updates, this is unlikely to be an issue. A DID Controller with concerns about that would need to take steps to control concurrent write access to the Log.
    9. Availability -- mentioned throughout. Mitigated somewhat by watchers.
        1. Leverage the work on Issuer Registries -- settled on using the OpenID Federation spec. Could add watchers to the Issuer data, and could build on the same trust mechanisms. See [this data about issuer registry research](https://blog.dcconsortium.org/selecting-the-openid-federation-specification-for-the-dcc-and-credential-engine-issuer-registry-f9079f620472).
    11. *"Witness Mechanism Immaturity: The optional witness feature lacks sufficient specification regarding discovery, operation, and security guarantees, limiting its current practical value"*
    12. [Suggestions for improvement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108sasow3PzJoS1VnL8xx_0_1MhoB4rLtxS1t3WIuQXs/edit?tab=t.tbxtos8dia2#heading=h.n9nkj8zf4901)
    13. *"A thoughtful attempt"* -- well done!
    14. No built in revocation/expiry, lack of privacy features, no verifiable timestamp.

6. Discussion: the path to v1.0?
    1. [Current Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues)
    2. Other issues:
        1. A number of issues have been [closed](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed).
        4. Issues to cover in the information site, not in the spec. [#170](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/170).
    5. THE TEST SUITE!!!
        1. Data Model Validator
            1. Test Suite input data set.
        2. Resolver Tests
            1. Negative data tests -- need a way to create negative tests, other than just by editing the data -- that would break the proofs.
        4. Generator Tests -- architecture/data
            1. Published keypairs
            2. How to express the evolution of a DID.
            3. How to do interoperability testing.
            4. How to define negative tests.
            5. How to run locally.
            6. How to publish the results for different implementations.
        5. Witnesses
        6. Watchers

7.  Any substantive changes pre-1.0?
    1. No! 

8. Plans for updates to the spec.
    1. Clarifications and simplifications.
    2. Cleaning up `[[spec]]` references and ref/defs.
    3. Security and Privacy sections. Anyone able to help?
    4. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.

    8. Dimitri to present on DID Web VH at IIW and participate in DID-related discussions.

5. Discussion: the path to v1.0?
    1. [Current Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues)
    2. Watchers discussion -- Complete -- merged. Only significant change was to remove the "witness-watcher" concept, and the API call to convey the pending entry to a witness to be signed.
    4. Other issues:
        1. A number of issues have been [closed](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed).
        2. [#189](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/189) -- need to update the examples, so need examples to use.
        3. [#188](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/188) -- clarifcation to be made to watchers section after current watchers PR is merged.
        4. Issues to cover in the information site, not in the spec. [#170](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/170), [#160](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/160).

6.  Do we have a definitive list of 1.0 changes?
    1.  Any changes needed? AFAIK, we qre done with 1.0. -- AGREED!
    2.  Next step is to declare the current version as 1.0 while still allowing for cleanups and clarifications.

7. Plans for updates to the spec.
    1. Clarifications and simplifications.
    2. Cleaning up `[[spec]]` references and ref/defs.
    3. Security and Privacy sections. Anyone able to help?
        4. Alexander Shenshin added some content this week. Broader review probably still needed.
    5. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.

    2. DONE - Patrick to add an OpenAPI specification for the watcher endpoints
    3. DONE - Stephen to add a new endpoint for requesting deletion of data from watchers

5. Discussion: the path to v1.0?
    1. [Current Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues)
    2. Watchers discussion -- [the current PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/181)
    4. Other issues:
        1. A number of issues have been [closed](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed).
        2. [#191](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/191) New issue about resolver returning an error if the DID being resolved is not in the DIDDoc -- either the requested version or latest version. PR [#192](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/192).  **Decision**:its OK if the location matches the `id` in *any* verified DIDDoc. PR Updated.
        3. [#189](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/189) -- need to update the examples, so need examples to use.
        4. [#188](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/188) -- clarifcation to be made to watchers section after current watchers PR is merged.
        5.  [#87](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/78) -- High Assurance DIDs with DNS.
            1. Do we need to find a VM public key via DNS instead of via the DID? No -- too constraining -- one key.
            2. Do we want to add a DNS record (with details) that proves something about the DID? Maybe -- a proof from the latest update key?  a proof from a (special?) witness?
                1. Is such a proof sufficient to demonstrate a DID-to-DNS binding?
            4. Leave it that the "non-did:web" DID-to-DNS binding be used.
            5. **Decision**: For 1.0 and interoperability, we'll leave it at option 3 and as an information site document, but not in the spec. Also gives time for the other spec. to stabilize and for us to consider if a did:webvh specific approach is needed.
        7. Issues to cover in the information site, not in the spec. [#170](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/170), [#160](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/160)
        8.  [#43](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/43) -- Additional resolver metadata -- needs details from implementers and then a PR. Minimal errors -- what to do if Log found but not the witness. PR updated.
        9.  [#23](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/23) -- Error Codes -- do we need them in the spec? Needs details from implementers. PR Updated.

6.  Do we have a definitive list of 1.0 changes?
    1.  DID Resolution metadata when there are invalid entries at the end of the log. DONE
    2.  Review Andrew's issue for the metadata to make sure that all are covered.

5. Discussion: the path to v1.0?
    1. [Current Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues)
    2. Watchers discussion -- [the current PR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/181) -- sufficient/complete? Overview:
        1. Adds an optional "`watcherURL`" to `witness`.
        2. Adds a `watchers` parameter that is a list of `watcherURL`s
        3. Defines that a `watcher` is a web server that responds to a set of GET and POST HTTP requests:
            1. GET DID Log, Witness Proofs, Resource (by path)
            2. POSTs are webhooks -- "DID Updated", "Resources Updated" (no content -- just a notification)
                1. Do we need to define retries or just mention that implementations should have an appropriate retry mechanism.
            3. For witness-watchers: "DID Entry" (includes the entry and a callback for the proof)
        4. Conversation -- add a "delete" request for the SCID and leave it to governance for what to do.
        5. Service entry for list of watchers, list of resources -- not needed -- automatically included in the DID Resolution metadata.
        6. Change the URLs to not be constrained to HTTP, but if they are here is how to use them.
    4. Other issues:
        1. A number of issues have been [closed](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed).
        2. [#189](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/189) -- need to update the examples, so need examples to use.
        3. [#188](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/188) -- clarifcation to be made to watchers section after current watchers PR is merged.
        4. [#131](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/131) -- Resolution issues -- PR added.
        5.  [#87](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/78) -- High Assurance DIDs with DNS -- Meeting with Jesse and Tim.  Define a witness based scheme, where the witness evidence is in the DNS record.
        6.  [#43](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/43) -- Additional resolver metadata -- needs details from implementers and then a PR.
        7.  [#23](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/23) -- Error Codes -- do we need them in the spec? Needs details from implementers.

6. Plans for updates to the spec.
    1. A ChatGPT pass, likely using the using the "Academic Assistant Pro" GPT. That should include DRYing the spec to remove duplication.
    2. Cleaning up `[[spec]]` references -- Brian has enabled us to add our own spec references.
    3. Security and Privacy sections. Anyone able to help?
    4. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.

5. Discussion: the path to v1.0?
    1. [Current Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues)
    2. Potential change - @andrewwhitehead wants to reevaluate witnesses and weights. See also issue [170](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/170) suggesting to remove weights.
        1. Threshold -- aim for the BFT problem.
            1. KERI -- weights are equal, so there is no incentive to attack specific witnesses.
            2. From the DID Log, we use did:keys, so there is no way to "attack" the witnesses. Stephen -- not sure this is right... :-)
            3. Andrew -- difficult to reason about it without including watchers and so on. Are witnesses needed to witness -- complicates the governance?
            4. Remove the weights -- yes or no? Yes remove them.  Can be added at the business layer if important.
        3. Multisig -- a different problem.  Each keeper gets a different weight, and its bound to the protocol.  What is it?  More than one participate that is a co-owner of an identifier.  Can have any, number of keys.
    4. Portability -- is it solid enough? @PatStLouis is considering this and may raise an issue. See issue [173-- make portability `true` by default](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/173).
        1. Downside of did:web was the lack of portability.
        2. A major mitigation to a number of web scenarios.  Why disable by default?
        3. Flag is there and it can be set to false if wanted.
        4. Half baked?  How do you find a DID after it has moved? 
        5. Default to `true` -- yes or no? No - leave it as is.

### Agenda and Notes<!-- omit in toc -->

1. Welcome and Adminstrivia
    1. Recording on?
    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. TS -- At v0.5 and deployed to npm as didwebvh-ts. Next up testing the NPM package.
    2. PY -- At v0.5 on PyPi. Compatible with the TS version based on some minimal testing. Plan a tweak to the witness verification approach. Planning some interop tests that can be run across all implementations.  A few test cases are needed - especially around witness cases.
    3. Server -- Gave a demo of AnonCreds objects published and resolved to implement a full credential flow. Developed with the ACA-Py plugin. Main focus security and loading/resolving. Working on revocation flow.
    4. did:webvh AnonCreds Method -- to be discussed.
    5. [did:webvh Static](https://github.com/OpSecId/webvh-static) -- no change. Next might be to add creating AnonCreds resources to show "real" examples.

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:
    1. DONE - Daniel/Stephen to collaborate on a best practices document for key references in DID documents, focusing on keeping valid keys in the current DID document now published on the [https://didwebvh.info](https://didwebvh.info/latest/implementers-guide/did-valid-keys/) site.
    2. DONE - Stephen has added the agenda link in the meeting information [here](https://didwebvh.info/latest/agenda/) on the [https://didwebvh.info](https://didwebvh.info) site.
    3. DONE - Brian to complete implementation of files resolution and witness functionality for v0.5 spec.
    4. DONE - Andrew to finish updates to the resolver for collecting witness rules and verifying proofs for v0.5 spec.
    5. PROGRESS - Patrick to focus on implementing uploading of an AnonCreds object on the web server. Internal demo given of a full issue-present-verify flow using credentials rooted in a did:webvh DID. Next up: including revocation.
    6. PROGRESS - Jamie to work on DIDComm protocol for requesting witness signatures. In ACA-Py plugin.
    7. PROGRESS - Patrick to implement witness and DID rotation features for the server.
    9. RESOLVED -- WON'T DO - did:webvh team to consider implementing the witness proofs as VCs in the`/whois` VP in a future version (v0.6 or later). See notes below on resolution.
    10. DONE - did:webvh team to further discuss and decide on the implementation of revocation registry entries.

5. Discussion: the path to v1.0?
    1. [Current Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues)
    2. Resolved [Issue 165 - Using /whois for witness proofs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/165) and agreed we wouldn't use `/whois` for witness proofs. It might be used by a witness to attest to the DID itself (not in the spec -- perhaps implementer's guide), but not for proofs on specific versions of the DID.
    3. Potential change - @andrewwhitehead wants to reevaluate witnesses and weights.
    4. Portability -- is it solid enough? @PatStLouis is considering this and may raise an issue.
    5. Watchers -- some thoughts were generated at the meeting and in issues raised. Specific issues with defined actions may follow.
    6. Clarification -- the step-by-step details of the verification, based on the experience of implementations, at a  general level. Likely for the implementers guide.

6. Revisiting DID Key references for rotated keys
    1. [Best practices document](https://didwebvh.info/latest/implementers-guide/did-valid-keys/) from Daniel Bluhm and Char Howland added to the [info site](https://didwebvh.info).

7. Progress on DID Resources using AnonCreds objects -- document: 
    1. Define the `attestedResource` object -- JSON, with an identified resource, a proof, with the resource (file) name the multihash of the resource `base58(multihash(JCS(resource)))`, with the file located using the (implicit or explicit) `#files` service -- e.g., by default relative to the root of the DID.
    2. Schema, CredDef are `attestedResources`. Their IDs are DID URLs calculated during generation and shared to other parties (e.g. `schemaID` is in the CredDef, `credDefId` is in the Credential).
        1. Does/can the resource name include the components of the object -- e.g. `schemaName`, `schemaVersion`, `tag`? Presumably, the controller can make that part of the DID URLs. Should we consider formalizing it?  E.g. `<did>/anoncreds/schema/ver/<schemaname>/<schemaver>/<attestedresouce>.json`
        2. Is there a way to get a list of all attestedResources, including their identifying metadata? What if the metadata is not part of the DID URLs?
        3. Should did:webvh formalize that a folder can be resolved with a list of contents returned (e.g. `<did>/anoncreds/schema/ver/` returns a list of `<schemaNames>`).
    3. RevRegDef is also an `attestedResource`, with its ID generated during creation, and shared from the Issuer to the Holder in the issued Credential.
    4. The RevRegDef contains a current list (index) of its RevRegEntry `attestedResource`s. When a new RevRegEntry is created and published, the index is updated with the `timestamp` and `attestedResource` identifier, and the RevRegDef resource is republished.
        1. The index is _outside_ of the resource that is attested. As such, the updates **do not** change the `attestedResource` name of the RevReg. The proof on the attested resource **DOES** get updated to include the index.
    5. A client needing a RevRegEntry for an arbitrary or specific timestamp, must:
        1. Retrieve the known associated `revRegDefId` `attestedResource`.
            1. The Holder knows the `id` because it is in the Credential from the Issuer.
            2. The Verifier knows the `id` because it is in the Presentation from the Holder.
        2. Scan the timestamps in the list (index) for the one of interest:
            1. Holder gets the one active at a given timestamp (or from/to period) from the verifier.
            2. Verifier gets the associated with a specific timestamp in the Presentation from the Holder.
        3. Use the `attestedResource` ID (DID URL) to get the RevRegEntry of interest.
            1. The RevRegEntry contains the full state of the RevReg at the given `timestamp`.
            2. The `did:webvh` AnonCreds method will not use deltas (as does Indy), but will use full state, as does Cheqd.
    6. Evolving design document: [AnonCreds in did:webvh](https://hackmd.io/@SpWXgFH9Rbyoa0JW3agDcg/HJU-4azPJl)

8. Plans for updates to the spec.
    1. A ChatGPT pass, likely using the using the "Academic Assistant Pro" GPT. That should include DRYing the spec to remove duplication.
    2. Cleaning up `[[spec]]` references -- Brian has enabled us to add our own spec references.
    3. Security and Privacy sections. Anyone able to help?
    4. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.

    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:
    1. did:webhv v0.5 is now official. No changes yet to the editor's draft.
    2. Implementations renamed to `didwebvh` -- [TS](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-ts), [Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-py) and [server](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-server-py). Renaming complete!
    3. did:webvh has been merged into the [DID Extensions](https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions) repo and is now a "listed" DID Method.
    4. Presentation on did:webplus was made at this week's DIF ID Working Group meeting ([Recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/KaANk-0AZ5igVvP4aOEyiPcOkqRQfnTMuJ9TTkATQ7_CL9cbfhTDxkOBP-DRzLZxNgwT-5rhCTqaHD-c.E7BFSM6Oixjv1WJa?canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&continueMode=true&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fus02web.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2Fv11q2vzVD5w4td993gMAtTcZqc_-kw5pyDH-D40p948FllhOXVG1_FREDuQJbIqN.hJy4KKg3ogK3E2LS)). Interesting presentation, focusing on a Web-based DID Method that emphasises tools (a "DID Gateway") to enable the long term resolution of DIDs -- years to decades -- regardless of the status of the original DID.

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. TS -- files resolution work near complete, about 50% complete of the witnesses, will do the `/whois`
    2. PY -- sync'd PR to renaming, generating a witness file, updates being made to the witness rules and proofs -- required some refactoring. Some updates to the interface to enable unit tests.
    3. Server -- opened some issues on the features -- especially resources. Current focus is on AnonCreds objects. Working on the witness -- enabling the process for witness proof request/response.
    4. A new project/repos was added to create static did:webvh DIDs and AnonCreds objects to enable testing. A series of small Python scripts -- useful for GHA for testing. [https://github.com/OpSecId/webvh-static](https://github.com/OpSecId/webvh-static).

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:
    1. **DONE** All participants to review the latest PR for v0.5 of the did:webvh specification.
    2. **DONE** [Commit](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/159/commits/e13e35b958ea14a9a79ae2616d905871d6aca5c3) Stephen to add a commit to the PR clarifying that null and an empty list both mean no pre-rotation for the next_key_hashes parameter.
    3. **DONE** Stephen to finalize and declare v0.5 of the specification after the PR is merged.
    4. Dmitri to find and share external specs related to key security events.
    5. **DONE** [Issue](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/161) Brian to create an issue about addressing right to deletion requests in the specification.
    6. **DONE?** Andrew to continue work on the resolver, including handling witness rules and improving caching behavior.
    7. **DONE?** All participants to join the did:webvh channel on the DIF Slack instance for future discussions.

5. Revisiting DID Key references for rotated keys
    1. Best practices: Retaining "valid" keys in the current DIDDoc vs. using DID version key references. What is the right way in the face of the need to revoke keys?
    2. There are techniques to declare a key "revoked".

6. Slack Topic: Using `/whois` as the holder of witness proofs
    1. Idea: Instead of current (v0.5) design of a file `witness.json` "beside" the `did.jsonl` containing proofs from the witnesses, we instead have the witnesses produce VCs that assert the version of the DID is valid, and the DID Controller puts the VCs into the `/whois` file. The same rules would apply about what VCs are needed -- at least the latest VC from a witness from a published DID entry. The `/whois` file containing the latest witness VCs **MUST** be published before publishing a new witnessed DID log entry.

6. Progress on DID Resources using AnonCreds objects as examples
    1. Goal -- an immutable object (via hash in the resource identifier), and a proof about the resource.
    2. Definition of an "attested resource" that can be the generically used as the most basic secured resource -- hash protected in the URL and signed by the DID Controller.
    3. The RevRegEntry use case -- periodically published objects that must be retained.
        1. Multiple access use cases -- "get latest", "get by ID", "get list by timestamp and then by ID"
    4. Evolving design document: [AnonCreds in did:webvh](https://hackmd.io/@SpWXgFH9Rbyoa0JW3agDcg/HJU-4azPJl)
    5. RevRegEntries
        1. Have a list that is a JSONL file that has the list of identifiers and each entry is a separate file.
            1. Related -- a did:webvh server **MAY** have a list of all DID Linked Resources. Must contain all of the files -- regardless of type. Perhaps we use that to get the list of RevRegEntries.
        2. Have a JSONL file that has all the entries. Get all the entries by retrieving the file. Can't be immutable in the identifier because the resource hash will change with each update to the log.

7. Plans for updates to the spec.
    1. A ChatGPT pass, likely using the using the "Academic Assistant Pro" GPT. That should include DRYing the spec to remove duplication.
    2. Cleaning up `[[spec]]` references -- Brian has enabled us to add our own spec references.
    3. Security and Privacy sections. Anyone able to help?
    4. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.

8. CEL proposal [announced by Manu](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2024Dec/0051.html).  I don't think we can use the spec directly, and it would complicate the explanations about what is in that spec, and what is in the did:webvh spec. Thoughts? There are some really useful ideas -- such as the ability to break logs into multiple files -- although we would want them in reverse from that they have defined.
