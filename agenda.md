    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:
    1. did:webvh [Implementations] repo created. Background provided later in the meeting.
    2. did:webvh Deep Dive completed at DIF/W3C DID Methods Standardization Working Group -- [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/6GhsVQ6VCIQiM5YyqkeAr4zg9RxcfxriKSi3tqQp5v0nad7Gdp52uXe5Pm3B26nz.SdHHNRMZJJcWmzZn), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VCD4z6yQ1nGezFngWWLDZ9xL6xnA8pkX5992jq0xEfA/edit?usp=sharing).

3. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- updates made to align with others.
    2. [Python] -- No updates -- interop and performance tests run.
    3. [Rust] -- No updates
    4. [Affinidi Rust] -- updates, interop testing, performance testing.
    5. [Server-Py] -- ready for use -- policy rules still being completed.
    6. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    7. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    8. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- policy implementation to match the server. DIDComm protocols for the witnessing -- both for log entries and for attested resources (initial use -- AnonCreds objects). Works with the ACA-Py Endorser Server repository at OWF. Allows control/governance over what can be published by a given instance of ACA-Py. Iterations of how to handle this -- now at a good place, including auto-approval and approval.
    9. [Test Suite] -- 
    10. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- 
    11. [Implementations] -- repo added, populated with initial implementations.

4. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. [PR 233](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/pull/233) DONE - Stephen to update the did:webvh specification with clearer guidelines on optional parameters and default values.
    2. DONE - Stephen to add the witness proof file analysis to the [FAQ section](https://didwebvh.info/latest/faq/) of the specification.
    3. DONE? - Glenn to make the performance testing code available for other implementations to use.
    4. DONE - Stephen to monitor and participate in discussions about DID method standardization at W3C.
    5. IN PROGRESS - Stephen to submit PRs for the pending issues listed in the specification repository.
    6. DONE Stephen to create a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348111717639344128/) announcing the release of ACA-Py 1.3.1 with did:webvh support.

5. Continued from last meeting, but with a concrete PR in place about what should be in the spec when describing optional parameters.
    1. Big question -- is this a new version, or leave it as 1.0?
       1. Decision -- leave it as 1.0. The added deprecation/resolver guidance in the PR will allow us to justify that.

6. New issues from implementation iterations:
    1. [\#235](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/235) -- Method can only increase -- agreed
    2. [\#236](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/236) -- Clarifying resolver witness proof handling requirements -- agreement, PR to be added.
    3. [\#234](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh/issues/234) -- Verifiable history of resources. Agreed that while this is interesting, it is not likely did:webvh specific. Could be a separate spec, or perhaps added in a later did:webvh version.
    4. Other PRs and Issues. Looked at the did:web one and almost ready -- Stephen has since added an update to deal with the `/whois` with a parallel DID.

7. The [Implementations] repo -- an overview from Patrick St. Louis.

8. Open Discussion -- what else do you want to discuss?

1. Welcome and Adminstrivia
    1. Recording on?
    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:webvh Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and requests for additional Agenda Topics

2. Announcements:
    1. Affinidi performance testing results.
        - 10 years of monthly DID updates -- 120 log entries.
        - Periodic witness and watcher updates
        - 197kb Log, 5.9kb witness file
        - 50ms to generate the log
        - 28ms to verify the log
        - "This is a very good performance result compared to other high-trust traceable DIDs (Keri, BlockChain). I can validate ~10 years of WebVH history in under 30ms, faster than likely fetching a web3 DID ;)"
    2. New: did:webvh implementations (TS, PY) pass the DID Test Suite ([link](https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#M51)).
      - Had to tweak the DID resolution document metadata for `threshold`, converting it a string when resolving -- still an integer in the Log Entry.

4. Status updates on the implementations
    1. [TS] -- working through change requests from Credo Team. Dealing with two version of Credo. Update for the `threshold` metadata.
    2. [Python] -- 
    3. [Rust] -- 
    4. [Server-Py] -- Policy features nearing completion.
    5. [Watcher-Py] -- 
    6. [did:webvh AnonCreds Method] -- 
    7. [did:webvh ACA-Py Plugin] -- Updated for ACA-Py 1.3.1 -- now deployable on a released version of ACA-Py.
    8. [Test Suite] -- 
    9. [did:webvh Tutorial] -- Updated for v1.0 spec.

5. To Do's from Last Meeting:

    1. Stephen to update the tutorial page on the web info site with Affinidi's tutorial details.
    2. DONE - Stephen to pursue clarification on witness handling with Glenn from Affinidi, based on Patrick's input.
    3. DONE - Stephen to add an issue and PR for adding service endpoints to the did:web equivalent of did:webvh.
    4. DONE - Stephen to add a note about including "also known as" references in both did:webvh and did:web documents.
    5. Patrick to update the tutorial to include service endpoints in the did:web example.
    6. IN PROGRESS - BC Gov team to continue work on implementing a production-level did:webvh system with policy enforcement mechanisms.
    7. IN PROGRESS - Patrick to continue development of the did:webvh server with configurable policy enforcement features.
    8. IN PROGRESS - Patrick to develop the endorser service as a plugin for supporting did:webvh in Traction.

8. Discussion on what should be in the spec when describing optional parameters.  How do we get the wording right to remove ambiguity?

   - Need developer input to get the wording right.
   
   - It gets tricky for the first entry (requires defaulting to some value) vs. later entries (previous value holds).
   
   - In future, when a DID changes the spec it is using, that may result in new parameters needing to be defaulted if not explicitly specified.
       - Changelog contents -- must include what new parameters and their defaults?
   
   - Must have a way to explictly turn off a value -- so include it but set it to the default -- not `null`.
   
   - Need to handle these issues:
       - Array -- "[]"
       - Dict -- "{}"
       - Strings -- "".
       - Avoid null, because null is not typed.
       - MUST: Accept parameters that are set to the default.
       - Optional parameters need not be present and if not present MUST be set to default.
   
   - Relevant part of the spec is [here](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0/#didwebvh-did-method-parameters).
   
   - Idea:
     - Define default value if not specified in the first applicable entry. Implementations can use that to initialize the setting.
     - Define allowed values if specified. In defining that, note the value to use to "turn off" a parameter.

7. Do we revert an earlier decision and put the witness proofs back into the DID Log? **NO!**
    - Eliminates the separate file/retrieval.
    - Allows "as you go" witnessing of Log Entries.
    - Increases the size of Log Files because witness proofs cannot be "optimized" -- removed when later ones are added.
        - Good to get an estimate on this.
        - Glenn Gore ([Affinidi](https://www.affinidi.com/)) provided us with one -- [Witness Proofs in Logs -- Test Scenario and Analysis](https://hackmd.io/-elL5qKYQgymxLUJxvDggg?view)
        - Based on the analysis, the increase in file size, plus the time to process the additional witness proofs makes the current scheme of separate files better -- we'll keep it.
    - Method -- Add proofs of witnesses to the `proof` item array.
        - I recall we discussed this earlier and decided not to use that approach because "proof sets" was not standardized?
        - Presumably, the proofs in an array have to be over the same content? If so, the witness "payload" for the proof would change to be in the same `proof` item.

8. Open Discussion -- what do you want to discuss?
